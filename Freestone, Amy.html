    <td>Biogeographic variation in interaction strength and invasions at the ocean's nearshore (Biovision)</td>
    <td>Global patterns of biodiversity demonstrate
    that most of the species on earth occur in the
    tropics, with strikingly fewer species occurring
    in higher-latitude regions. Biologists predict
    that this global pattern of species diversity is
    likely shaped by ecological species
    interactions. Yet few detailed experimental
    data exist that demonstrate how species
    interactions influence ecological communities
    from the tropics to the arctic. </td>
