    <td>Neuroimmune Regulation of JC Virus Gene Expression in Glial Cells</td>
    <td>Patients undergoing immune modulatory therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, and individuals with an impaired-immune system, most notably AIDS patients, are in the high risk group of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopath (PML), a fatal demyelinating disease of the white matter caused by human neurotropic polyomavirus, JC virus. We employ multidisciplinary strategies to determine molecular mechanism of JC virus reactivation during the latent period of viral infection. </td>
