    <td>Phylomedicine of vector-borne pathogens</td>
    <td>It is increasingly evident that genomic
  information, together with concepts from
  epidemiology and evolutionary biology, allows
  for testing of hypotheses and exploration of
  scenarios that otherwise could not be
  investigated by traditional approaches. Our lab
  characterizes the processes shaping the
  genetic variation of vector-borne parasites and
  viruses. In particular, we utilize genetic data to
  learn how pathogen populations respond to
  the selective pressures exerted by the host
  immune system or antimicrobial drugs.</td>

    <td>I am looking for highly motivated students who
  are interested in gaining research experience.
  A minimum of 3.7 GPA is required. Students
  should interview with the PI. Our expectation
  is that the selected candidates will continue to
  work with us after the summer. Traditionally,
  undergraduate students appear as co-authors
  in per-reviewed publications. </td>
