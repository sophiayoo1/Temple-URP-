    <td>Simulating Networks of Brain Cells Under Synapse Loss</td>
    <td>The student researcher will get to know novel
    simulation tools to simulate neural networks
    and use these tools to investigate the behavior
    of networks when connections between cells,
    so called synapses, are lost. This effect is
    common in diseases like Alzheimer's and
    identifying ways for cells to compensate
    synapse loss is of great importance. The focus
    of this project is to systematically simulate
    network behavior under various neurodegenerative
    conditions with the goal of
    identifying cellular components that can
    compensate synapse loss. </td>

    <td>Investigating Biofilm Dynamics</td>
    <td>In a collaboration with Bettina Buttaro
    (Temple Medicine), imaging data will be used
    to study the dynamics of cell movement within
    biofilms. These dynamics are very important in
    human function and spatio-temporal dynamics
    at the ultrastructural level not yet well
    understood. In this project the student
    researcher will get to know novel
    computational tools to study biofilm dynamics
    and collaborate on an interdisciplinary project
    combining mathematical methods and medical
    imaging.</td>

    <td>Modeling and Simulation of Calcium Dynamics in Healthy and Diseased Neurons</td>
    <td>In this project the student researcher will use
    novel simulation tools to simulate and
    evaluate the dynamics of calcium signals in
    neurons. Calcium is one of the most important
    molecules in neuronal signaling and is
    implicated in multiple ageing-related
    neurodegenerative diseases. The project will
    focus on systematically simulating cell-calcium
    dynamics under the influence of calcium
    regulating parameter sets representing healthy
    and disease-state neurons. </td>
