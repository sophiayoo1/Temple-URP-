    <td>Analysis of a Gene-regulatory Ribonuclease Complex</td>
    <td>Proteomic analyses of protein-protein interactions in the bacterium Escherichia coli suggest that two ribonucleases, RNase III and RNase II, as
    well as the protein YmdB, function as a complex to process RNA molecules. We
    will investigate how RNase III and RNase II may work in concert to processRNA, and how YmdB regulates the action of RNase III. These experiments will use purified recombinant proteins and RNA substrates to examine the activity of the protein complex and the individual proteins.</td>

    <td>Understanding ribonuclease mechanism and function in gene regulation</td>
    <td>We apply biochemical and molecular genetic techniques to probe the mechanism of ribonucleases and their function in gene expression and RNA stability. Our primary system is the bacterial cell, and we seek to understand how bacterial cell mobility, biofilm formation, and response to stress are regulated by ribonucleases.</td>
