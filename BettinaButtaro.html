    <td>Enterococcal Pheromone Inducible Conjugative Plasmids as Virulence Factors and Disseminators of Antibiotic Resistance Genes</td>
    <td>Pheromone inducible conjugative plasmids, such as pCF10, play a central role in the ability of Enterococcal faecalis to cause disease. They encode antibiotic resistance and virulence genes in addition to mediating transfer of chromosomal determinants between strains. These plasmids also contribute to the ability of the bacteria to cause disease and to spread antibiotic resistance genes to other species and genera of bacteria. The goal of the chemistry/biochemisty projects is to characterize the molecular mechanisms that allow the bacteria to vary the copy number of the plasmids in response to oxidative stress. The goal of the biology projects is to understand how the plasmid transfers antibiotic resistance genes to bacteria in mixed species biofilms.</td>

    <td>Antibiotic Resistance Gene Transfer Mediated by Enterococcus Faecalis Plasmid pCF10</td>
    <td>The plasmid makes helps make E. faecalis antibiotic resistant and virulent. Current biochemistry projects focus on characterizing how oxidative stress increases the number of plasmids in the bacterial cell. The biology projects focus on how the plasmid transfers antibiotic resistance genes to other bacteria in mixed species biofilms.</td>
