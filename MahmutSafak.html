    <td>Understanding the Regulatory Roles of JC Virus Agnoprotein in Viral Life Cycle</td>
    <td>JC virus is a human polyomavirus that causes a fatal disease, known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, in the central nervous system of a sub-population of immunocompromised individuals including AIDS and cancer patients. This virus encodes a small regulatory protein, Agnoprotein, from its late coding region. In the absence of its expression, this virus unable to sustain its productive life cycle. It is a highly basic phosphoprotein that localizes mostly to the perinuclear area of infected cells, although a small amount of the protein is also found in nucleus. It forms highly stable dimers/oligomers in vitro and in vivo through its Leu/Ile/Phe-rich domain.  </td>

    <td>Investigation of the Regulatory Roles of JC virus Agnoprotein in Viral Life Cycle</td>
    <td>Agnoprotein is one of the important regulatory proteins of the human polyomavirus, JC virus. It is a relatively small and basic protein. we have recently demonstrated that it forms highly stable dimers and oligomers. It exhibits the ability to be released from the infected cells. The implications of this release unknown. It appears to bind to viral transcripts and ins involved in the splicing and nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of these transcripts. Three dimensional structure of this protein has been recently resolved by our lab, confirming the involvement of dimerization domain in alphahelix formation. Our lab has been heavily involved in characterization of the regulatory roles of this protein in viral life cycle in the past and we will to do so for the next five year. </td>
