    <td>Mutation Analysis in Emphysema</td>
    <td>Two million Americans suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, costing $2.5 billion/year and contributing to 100,000 deaths/year. Emphysema is caused by the destruction of alveolar wall septa, which is associated with inflammation. Alveolar type II cells make and secrete pulmonary surfactant and restore the epithelium after damage. In our preliminary data we identified 6 mutations in genomic DNA obtained from alveolar type II cells isolated from patients with emphysema. Our hypothesis is that these mutations may contribute to this disease pathogenesis. Student task and responsibility: The student will first get training in general laboratory techniques. This person will be involved in planning experiments with a research group, preparing samples for DNA isolation and analyze sequencing results. We will meet at least once every week to discuss this project.</td>

    <td>The Role of Microvesicles in Emphysema</td>
    <td>Microvesicles are small membrane vesicles of 30â€“1,000 nm in diameter that are released into the extracellular environment under normal or pathological conditions by different types of cells including alveolar type II cells. Our hypothesis is that microvesicles secreted in emphysema may contain inflammatory factors, which can induce injury of neighboring cells. In our preliminary data, we found higher microvesicles secretion in alveolar type II cells isolated from patients with this disease compared to control non-smokers and smokers. </td>
